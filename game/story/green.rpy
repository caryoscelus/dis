    "Green.{w} Bright, unnatural green."
    "Green.{w} Not the colour of grass and leaves, but the colour of a LED lamp in the beautiful decorated shade, hanging from the ceiling."
    "I look around.{w} This is indeed a kitchen.{w} Small, but cozy.{w} All the place in the centre is taken by a wooden table.{w} There's a bottle of wine and two glasses on it.{w} One glass is empty and another one is half-full."
    "Between the glasses there's something that i don't see quite clearly."
    "The rest of kitchen is filled with nice furniture, none of which pique my curiosity."
    "All of it looks normal and familiar.{w} Even lack of window feels appropriate."

    "Aww..{w} the pain strikes again in the back of my head.{w} I even close my eyes."
    "When it ceases, i'm still sitting on the chair and in front of, on the table, stays laptop.{w} I haven't payed much attention to it before, but now it's so close that i can't help being interested."

    "Fortunately, there's no lock screen and i see the desktop wallpaper.{w} There are few minimized windows so i skim through them.{w} File manager, IDE, music player and web browser.{w} The latter is opened on page with text \"Ludum Dare 32 theme is..\""
    "I don't feel like reading further.{w} Pain pokes me in the back of my head, but this time it's not strong."
    "I close the browser.{w} I briefly look at IDE, but there's only a freshly-created project named ld32 in it."

    "This could be an artificial peace, but as long as i can stay here, that's ok."

    "Blue.{w} Cold and somewhat mysterious colour."
    "Blue.{w} Colour of sea and sky.{w} But here on quaint ceramic tiles it doesn't bring the lightness or expansing freedom to the atmosphere of the room.{w} It only symbolizes lifeless water enclosed in the pipes."

    "My face..{w} it's covered with blood, which looks almost black in this blue-shaded room.{w} It's not that visible on my black hair, but by the way strands are glued and messed up i can guess they are bloody as well."
    "For a moment i see my face in the mirror make scary smile.{w} No, that's not me! I don't smile like that!"
    "But, blood!{w} I check my face with my clean hands and it feels sticky and dirty."
    "I look at my hands and sure enough they are covered with dark red substance."
